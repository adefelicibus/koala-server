    <div class="infomessage">
        This is an open server to anyone can
        use for running tools and workflows on real-world data.
        However, the computational resources are limited.
        We have plans to improve the infrastructure in order to create a
        useful server.
        Please, use it carefully because this server is alpha version.

        <b>Login</b><br>
        As it is an open server, you can use the server without logging.
        Although, to use workflow and shared resources, you must log in.
        To create an account, register under "User->Register".<br>
        With an account, log in under "User->Login".

        <b>Workflows available</b><br>
        Koala Server has a set of generic workflows available. You can import, modify or run them by accessing the Shared Data - Published Workflows or by this <a href="../workflow/list_published">link</a>.<br>
        The workflows <i>Ranking of solutions by Sort by Front Dominance</i> and <i>Comparison of predictions by RMSD, GDT-TS and TM-Score</i> are the two most completed workflows built on Koala Server to perform predictions with all the algorithms available and analysis with different methods.<br>
        <a href="/u/adefelicibus-15/w/ranking-of-solutions-by-sort-by-front-dominance"><b>Ranking of solutions by Sort by Front Dominance</b></a>: This workflow has 16 steps to run. This runs all the predictor algorithms available on Koala using the same amino acids sequence. Once all the algorithms are finished, their results are sent to the method Sort by Front Dominance to create a ranking with the best solutions according to a combination of two objectives. The final result is an HTML report.<br>
        <a href="/u/adefelicibus-15/w/comparison-of-predictions-by-rmsd-gdt-ts-and-tm-score"><b>Comparison of predictions by RMSD, GDT-TS and TM-Score</b></a>: This workflow has 19 steps to run. This workflow also runs all the predictor algorithms available on Koala. Besides the amino acid sequence, this workflow recieves a PDB file to be used as a reference to the metrics RMSD, GDT-TS and TM-Score. All the results generated by the algorithms are sent to these metrics. The final result is an HTML report.
